# Documentation Updates Summary

## üìù **Changes Made to Remove Unsubstantiated Claims**

### **Date**: September 14, 2025

---

## ‚ùå **Removed Unsubstantiated Claims**

### **1. Legal Industry Statistics**
**Removed**:
- "Legal professionals spend 40% of their time on document research"
- "Miss 30% of relevant precedents"
- "40% of billable hours spent on research"
- "90% similarity matching"
- "70% reduction in research time"
- "90%+ accuracy in legal research"
- "300%+ return on investment"

**Reason**: No verifiable sources found for these specific statistics

### **2. Performance Claims Without Evidence**
**Removed**:
- "99.9% availability"
- "100+ documents per hour"
- "$2,000+ savings per case"
- "40% faster case resolution"

**Reason**: These are projections/estimates without actual test data

---

## ‚úÖ **Replaced With Evidence-Based Statements**

### **1. Problem Statement**
**Before**: Specific percentages without sources
**After**: General statements about legal document processing challenges

**New Text**:
```
Legal professionals process thousands of unstructured legal documents including contracts, briefs, and case files. Traditional document analysis relies heavily on manual review and keyword-based search, which can be time-consuming and may miss relevant precedents or patterns in large document collections.
```

### **2. Performance Metrics**
**Before**: Unsubstantiated business impact claims
**After**: Measured technical performance with evidence

**New Text**:
```
### **Technical Performance (Tested)**
- **Document Processing**: 2.17 seconds per document (ML.GENERATE_TEXT) - *Tested with caselaw_000001*
- **Similarity Search**: 1-2 seconds for top-10 similar cases (VECTOR_SEARCH) - *Tested with "insurance contract dispute"*
- **Embedding Generation**: 2,421 documents/minute (Fast Pipeline) - *Measured during batch processing*
```

### **3. Business Impact**
**Before**: Specific ROI and savings claims
**After**: Projected benefits without specific numbers

**New Text**:
```
### **Business Impact (Projected)**
- **Time Savings**: Potential reduction in manual document review time
- **Cost Reduction**: Potential savings through automated processing
- **Quality Improvement**: Consistent AI-powered analysis vs. manual review
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native architecture supports growth
- **ROI**: Potential return through efficiency gains
```

## üìä **Evidence-Based Metrics Retained**

### **All metrics now include evidence sources**:

1. **Processing Times**: From actual test execution
2. **Document Counts**: From BigQuery table verification
3. **Similarity Scores**: From VECTOR_SEARCH test results
4. **Error Rates**: From comprehensive testing
5. **Coverage**: From embedding status checks

### **Evidence Sources**:
- Terminal output from test execution
- BigQuery query results
- Measured processing times
- Verified row counts
- Actual function test results
