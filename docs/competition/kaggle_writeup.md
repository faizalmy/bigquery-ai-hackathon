## üìã **Problem Statement**

Legal professionals spend 40% of their time on document research and analysis, processing thousands of unstructured legal documents including contracts, briefs, and case files. Existing tools require manual work and miss 30% of relevant precedents, making it hard to find patterns, generate summaries, or extract key legal insights efficiently.

**Key Challenges:**
- **Manual Processing**: Legal professionals manually review thousands of documents
- **Missed Precedents**: 30% of relevant case law is overlooked due to keyword-only search
- **Time Inefficiency**: 40% of billable hours spent on research instead of strategy
- **Inconsistent Analysis**: Human analysis varies in quality and completeness
- **Scalability Issues**: Current tools don't scale with document volume
