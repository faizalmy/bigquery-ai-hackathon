## Detailed Sequence Flow Analysis

### **Phase 1: Document Input and Preprocessing (0-2 seconds)**
```
User → API → Document Preprocessing → Content Extraction
```
- **User submits** legal document through BigQuery API
- **API validates** document format and content
- **Content extraction** prepares clean text for AI processing
- **Parallel processing** initiation for both tracks

### **Phase 2: Parallel AI Processing (0-7 seconds)**
```
Track 1 (Generative AI) || Track 2 (Vector Search)
```

#### **Track 1: Generative AI Functions**
- **ML.GENERATE_TEXT** (6.99s): Document summarization
- **AI.GENERATE_TABLE** (6.82s): Structured data extraction
- **AI.GENERATE_BOOL** (0.48s): Urgency classification
- **AI.FORECAST** (1.29s): Case outcome predictions

#### **Track 2: Vector Search Functions**
- **ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING**: Document vectorization
- **VECTOR_SEARCH** (3.33-4.36s): Semantic similarity search
- **ML.DISTANCE**: Cosine similarity calculations

### **Phase 3: Data Storage and Integration (7-8 seconds)**
```
Storage ← Track 1 Results
Storage ← Track 2 Results
Storage → Hybrid Intelligence Engine
```
- **Results storage** from both processing tracks
- **Data retrieval** for hybrid intelligence processing
- **Cross-referencing** between generative and vector results

### **Phase 4: Hybrid Intelligence Processing (8-9 seconds)**
```
Engine → Cross-reference Results → Generate Insights → Store Intelligence
```
- **Hybrid Intelligence Engine** combines both track outputs
- **Cross-referencing** between generative insights and vector similarities
- **Integrated intelligence** generation and storage

### **Phase 5: Dashboard Generation (9-10 seconds)**
```
Storage → Dashboard → Visualizations → Business Intelligence Reports
```
- **Dashboard generation** with integrated data
- **Visualization creation** for user interface
- **Business intelligence** report compilation

### **Phase 6: Results Delivery and Business Value (10+ seconds)**
```
Dashboard → User → Decision Making → Process Automation
```
- **Legal Intelligence Dashboard** delivery to user
- **User review** of all generated insights
- **Business value realization** through improved decision-making
